## Data-Wrangling-analysis

- The objective of this work is to demonstrate the data preprocessing knowledge and skill that I have gained throughout the Data Wrangling course.
- I wanted to investigate if there was any relationship between a countryâ€™s GDP per Capita and its healthspending? To achieve that, I wanted to perform a regression analysis of the variable of interest toinvestigate whether the outcome is statistically significant or not.
- To have broad coverage, instead of G7 or G20, I have focused my investigation on OECD (Organisationfor Economic Co-operation and Development) countries which is an association of 37 nations. Further,considered a wide timeframe of 20 years to make the data robust enough to perform complex analysis.
- Three different datasets from two different sources were imported.
- Then, inspected the datasets and explored the structures and attributes. Checked each dataset with aproper understanding of each variable.
- After that, filtered out the necessary data required for my analysis and converted it to an appropriatedata type.
- One of the dataset was untidy. So, reshaped the data to ensure that the dataset follows tidy data rules.
- After that I merged all three datasets together to prepare a holistic database that can meet my entireanalysis requirement.
- Next, created one new variable that provided additional insights and enabled further analysis.
- After that data were scanned for or missing values, special values, and obvious errors and suitablesteps were taken to handle those values.
- Numeric data variables were checked for any potential outlier and provided detailed analysis andrationale to keep those identified outliers intact.
- Finally applied different data transformation methods and shortlisted the approach that showed relativelybetter performance in terms of reducing the skewness in the numeric data.
