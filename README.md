## Data-Wrangling-analysis

The objective of this work is to demonstrate the data preprocessing knowledge and skill that I have gained throughout the Data Wrangling course.
I wanted to investigate if there was any relationship between a country’s GDP per Capita and its healthspending? To achieve that, I wanted to perform a regression analysis of the variable of interest toinvestigate whether the outcome is statistically significant or not.
To have broad coverage, instead of G7 or G20, I have focused my investigation on OECD (Organisationfor Economic Co-operation and Development) countries which is an association of 37 nations. Further,considered a wide timeframe of 20 years to make the data robust enough to perform complex analysis.
Three different datasets from two different sources were imported.
Then, inspected the datasets and explored the structures and attributes. Checked each dataset with aproper understanding of each variable.
After that, filtered out the necessary data required for my analysis and converted it to an appropriatedata type.
One of the dataset was untidy. So, reshaped the data to ensure that the dataset follows tidy data rules.
After that I merged all three datasets together to prepare a holistic database that can meet my entireanalysis requirement.
Next, created one new variable that provided additional insights and enabled further analysis.
After that data were scanned for or missing values, special values, and obvious errors and suitablesteps were taken to handle those values.
Numeric data variables were checked for any potential outlier and provided detailed analysis andrationale to keep those identified outliers intact.
Finally applied different data transformation methods and shortlisted the approach that showed relativelybetter performance in terms of reducing the skewness in the numeric data.
